It is not easy for humans to distinguish between real and fake images. Realistic fake images intensify concerns about the disinformation dissemination. To tackle this problem, various fake image detection approaches have been proposed. However, most detectors only evaluate their performance over partial generative models. It is important to build a benchmark to review existing detectors with comprehensive generative models. Since existing detectors are always trained over different training sets, an alternative goal of this benchmark is to evaluate the generalization of existing detectors with fair conditions.
